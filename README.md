# Server Power Management

A set software components designed for managing computers / servers with support for Wake On LAN protocol and IPMI interfaces






### Software components
- Library: Contains most of the functions for detecting and sending power on / off signals via lan
- Frontent: The easy to use GUI that provides a simple table for easy management of each computer / server. It imports the SPM library at runtime (Powered by [WxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/))
- Service daemon: The service that only runs on linux and listens for LAN singnals (power off, get user, ip, broadcast ip, mac addres)
- CLI: Provides a small command line inteerface along with a builtin shell
- Web page: A web page interface that fully resembles the frontend version. This feature is provided in the CLI;
